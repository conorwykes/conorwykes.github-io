                        A number of caravans and quad bikes on the site have been identified as stolen, according to police.

                        The air weapons will now be tested. Only air weapons that use, or are designed or adapted for use with a self-contained gas cartridge system are prohibited under the Firearms Act.

                        Seven people have been arrested on suspicion of offences including possession of criminal property, possession of ammunition, handling stolen goods and burglary.

                        Two people found at the site are being supported by the Met's Modern Slavery Team, the Met said.


                        A total of 17 dogs were seized from the site, some of which have since been reportedly been identified as stolen.

                        Commander Kyle Gordon, the Gold Commander for the operation, said:   “We have already found a number of weapons and other items of interest following this significant operation, and our searches at the site will continue.

                        “A firearm seized by police represents a weapon that is not in the hands of someone who might use it to harm others, and commit crime.

                        A person at a school in Bromley tested positive for coronavirus during routine testing for the Government.

                        Red Hill Primary School, in Chislehurst, confirmed an individual at the school has coronavirus and that everyone who was considered a 'close contact' has been asked to self-isolate for 14 days.

                        Headteacher Nicola Crockatt said: "We can confirm that an individual tested positive for Covid-19 last week. They were asymptomatic and the individual was undertaking routine testing as part of the National Office of Statistics.

                        "The school identified all close contacts of the individual who were asked to isolate for 14 days, and were advised to book a test if they began to show symptoms of Covid-19 themselves.

                        "Home education commenced immediately for the children who are now isolating. We look forward to welcoming them back to school once the isolation period is complete."

                        Police have found at least 15 dogs while carrying out a police raid in Orpington, and need the help of Londoners to return them to their owners.

                        The series of dogs found have been confirmed stolen, or at suspected to be.

                        There appears to be a mixture of both puppies and adult dogs, all of a wide range of breeds.
